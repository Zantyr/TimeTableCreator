<center><h3>My name is Paweł Tomasik. I'm 22 and love thinking.</h3></center>
<p>I study Technical Physics at Gdańsk University of Technology, finishing a bachelor/engineer degree in Feb 2017. My greatest assets are: analytical thinking, fluent command of English, understanding of Maths and Physics, programming abilities.</p>
<p>I am learning Python and used C++, HTML, PHP, a little bit of JS, and MatLab. I find myself liking programming and getting it quite easy, despite of little education in particular disciplines of it. However, you may ask for sources which I have currently done.</p>
